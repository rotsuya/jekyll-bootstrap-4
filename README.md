# Bootstrap 4 + Jekyll

To use: when you have the dependancies as per
[the docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) you should run
`bundle install`.
    
HTML files are based on Minima - if you need to configure
the post or page layouts, copy [those files](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts) in as needed.
    
Bootstrap variables can be overriden in `_sass/custom.scss` - refer
to the [full list of available values](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss).

Note that GitHub Pages doesn't run gems that aren't on their predefined list, so I included the source files of Bootstrap.
